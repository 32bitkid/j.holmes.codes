**Watercolorizer** is a _tiny_ graphics library for creating generative watercolor-like shapes from simple polygonal base-shapes. This _core_ library is un-opinionated about the rendering process and instead focuses on the generative algorithm for constructing the paths to be rendered.

See all [@watercolorizer](https://www.npmjs.com/org/watercolorizer) packages on npmjs.
