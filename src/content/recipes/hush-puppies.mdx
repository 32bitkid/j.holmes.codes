> _**Protip**_ &#x261E; Adding diced jalapeno, green onion, or bell pepper would also be delicious.

> _**Protip**_ &#x261E; Depending on the size of the balls, it might take a while for the center to be cooked/set. Use a toothpick test (should come out clean) to check. You can also toss them into a 300&deg; oven after frying to finish and/or keep warm.

> _**Protip**_ &#x261E; To get more evenly sized balls, shape with water moistened hands to prevent the dough from sticking. If dough is too "loose" to shape, mix 25&ndash;50 g flour.
