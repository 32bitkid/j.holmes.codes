I've known for quite a while that, you could inject content into HTML elements using CSS pseudo&#x2011;elements: `::before` and `::after`. But, they are _way_ more useful than I originally thought&hellip;

---

## The Simple Stuff

Simply put, pseudo&#x2011;elements let you inject CSS content _immediately before_ or _immediately after_ the content of the matched element.

For example, suppose I want all paragraphs in my document to start with the phrase "Yo dog, ". I could write:

```css
p::before {
  content: 'Yo dog, ';
}
```

Instead of using a string, one can also link to another resource using the `url()` css function. Here is a style that matches any anchor with an absolute url and injects an icon after them.

```css
a[href^="http://"]:after, a[href^="https://"]:after
{
  content: url('path-to-external-icon.png');
}
```

## Got it! Anything else?

Yea!

The other day I ended up on [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) for the `content` property. I noticed something new: the `attr()` value.

The `attr()` value returns the _value_ of the attribute on the element as a string. I can make a context hover for external links to display their `href` by doing something like this:

```css
a {
  position: relative;
}

a[href^="http://"]:hover:after, a[href^=https://]:hover:after
{
  /* Display the href attribute */
  content: attr(href);

  /* Put it in a box */
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  padding: 1em;
  border: 1px solid #666;
  background-color: #ccc;
}
```

And now you have a no-js hover for links&hellip;

## One step further!

Things got _more_ interesting when I realized I could do the same with HTML5 `data-` attributes. Consider the following markup:

```html
<div class="greet" data-greeting="Hola">Jim</div>
```

Then I could do something like this:

```css
.greet:before {
  content: attr(data-greeting) ' ';
}
```

Apparently this was old news. A quick google search turned up a bunch of people talking about it a while ago, but it was news to me! I'm not sure where I would get to use it, but I do like that it helps keep the DOM pretty, and it makes it simple to update certain things from javascript.

```js
var forEach = Function.prototype.call.bind(Array.prototype.forEach),
  changeToHello = function (elem) {
    elem.dataset.greeting = 'Hello';
  };

var greetings = document.querySelectorAll('.greet');
forEach(greetings, changeToHello);
```

It almost shadow-dom-esque. It's nice not having to know the internals of how the element is going to consume the `data-` attribute, one can just update the elements' state and be done.

## The future and beyond&hellip;

There is one unimplemented feature that would also help make this technique a lot more powerful: the optional `[type]` argument of the `attr()` function. The [spec defines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) such behavior but, as of writing this _no browsers_ implement it.

```css
.hasIcon:before {
  content: attr(data-icon-url url);
}
```

This would return the value of the `data-icon-url` attribute, but interpret its value as a URL rather than just a string. It would be pretty useful for injecting icons&hellip;
