I've known for quite a while that, you could inject content into
HTML elements using CSS pseudo&#x2011;elements: `::before` and
`::after`. But, they are _way_ more useful than I originally thought&hellip;

***

## The Simple Stuff

Simply put, pseudo&#x2011;elements let you inject CSS content _immediately before_ or _immediately after_ the content of the matched element.

For example, suppose I want all paragraphs in my document to start with the phrase "Yo dog, ". I could write:

<Figure caption="Xzibit would be proud!" code>
    ```css
    p::before { content: "Yo dog, "; }
    ```
</Figure>

Instead of using a string, one can also link to another resource using the `url()` css function. Here is a style that matches any anchor with an absolute url and injects an icon after them.

<Figure caption="Adding images as content." code>
    ```css
    a[href^="http://"]:after, a[href^="https://"]:after {
      content: url('path-to-external-icon.png');
    }
    ```
</Figure>

## Got it! Anything else?

Yea!

The other day I ended up on [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content)
for the `content` property. I noticed something new: the `attr()` value.

The `attr()` value returns the *value* of the attribute
on the element as a string. I can make a context hover for external
links to display thier `href` by doing something like this:

<Figure caption="Or&hellip; you could just use title attribute." code>
    ```css
    a { position: relative; }

    a[href^="http://"]:hover:after, a[href^=https://]:hover:after {
      /* Display the href attribute */
      content: attr(href);

      /* Put it in a box */
      display: block;
      position: absolute;
      padding: 1em;
      border: 1px solid #666;
      background-color: #ccc;
    }
    ```
</Figure>

And now you have a no-js hover for links&hellip;

## One step further!

Things got *more* interesting when I realized I could
do the same with HTML5 `data-` attributes. Consider the following markup:

<Figure code>
    ```html
    <div class="greet" data-greeting="Hola">Jim</div>
    ```
</Figure>

Then I could do something like this:

<Figure code>
    ```css
    .greet:before {
      content: attr(data-greeting) " ";
    }
    ```
</Figure>

Aparently this was old news. A quick google search turned up a bunch
of people talking about it a while ago, but it was news to me! I'm not sure
where I would get to use it, but I do like that it helps keep the DOM pretty
and it makes it simple to update certain things from javascript.

<Figure code>
    ```js
    var forEach = Function.prototype.call.bind(Array.prototype.forEach),
        changeToHello = function(elem) {
          elem.dataset.greeting = "Hello";
        });

    var greetings = document.querySelectorAll(".greet");
    forEach(greetings, changeToHello);
    ```
</Figure>

It almost shadow-dom-esque. It's nice not having to know the internals
of how the element is going to consume the `data-` attribute, one can
just update the elements' state and be done.

## The future and beyond&hellip;

There is one unimplemented feature that would also help make this
technique a lot more powerful: the optional `[type]` argument of
the `attr()` function. The [spec defines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) such
behavior but, as of writing this *no browsers* implement it.

<Figure caption="This would be great!" code>
    ```css
    .hasIcon:before {
      content: attr(data-icon-url url);
    }
    ```
</Figure>

This would return the value of the `data-icon-url` attribute, but intrept
it's value as a url rather than just a string. It would be pretty useful
for injecting icons&hellip;
