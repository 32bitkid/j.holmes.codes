  During the most recent updates to the site, I decided to remove some embeds to some of the more popular Codepen pens that I've done through the years. Why?

I've been a huge fan [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), and by extension [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/), for a really long time now. I wouldn't be nearly as good of a UI/UX Engineer as I am today, or as proficient with HTML/CSS/JS, if **Codepen** did not exist. Not only because of _myself_&mdash;challenging myself to finish and publish small ideas that I wouldn't have normally completed&mdash;but also because of the community of other **developers**/**engineers**/**designers** that I've learned from through code they've shared. People like [Ana Tudor](https://thebabydino.github.io/), [Yoav Kadosh](https://yoavik.com/), and [Natalia Davydova](https://github.com/nat-davydova) just to name a _few_.

I've been a [Codepen PRO](https://codepen.io/features/pro) subscriber quite a while[^1]! So, I'm obviously a big fan of what **Codepen** is all about. So, why then have I removed the **Codepen** embeds from my [home page](/)?

## Privacy

I've been thinking a lot recently about [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), [net-privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy), user-tracking, and AI harvesting. And, _for me_, I think these are topics that I want to spend more time _thinking_ about and _doing_ something about this year and the next. I think these are _big topics_, that are complex and nuanced. But _this_ something that I _can_ do something about _today_: _limit_ the exposure for sites that I have _100%_ control over. Namely, this one. I don't use any other user-trackers or analytics. I don't really _care_ about tracking clicks or impressions or funneling people to affiliate links. So, while I don't think or have any reason to suspect that **Codepen** is doing anything _untoward_, it _is_ the only third-party cookie that is on this site. And I'd like to change that&hellip;

So, I'm _taking embeds out_ and replacing them with static images that will link to the service instead. After all, **Codepen** is still a service that I love and use often. However, I think the right call _for me_; _not_ to **opt-in** everyone who happens to visit the site and just hope everything is legit.ðŸ¤ž

## Conclusion

I know its _small thing_ and probably not _that_ important. In the grand scale of the challenges that we face in the near-future, it's admittedly _small_. But, like I said, it's maybe a tiny, little _step-in-the-right-direction_.

[^1]: I just went to my account to go see how long, and wow: <MonthFmt date="2014-06"/>, more than a _decade_!
