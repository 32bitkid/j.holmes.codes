## TL;DR

I used [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to reorganize _three_ packages, in _two_ different monorepos, into a _new_ monorepo while maintaining the commit history in the new repository.

## The Setup

Way back when I first started working on [github.com/32bitkid/sci.js](https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js), I realized pretty early that I needed a [`BitReader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@4bitlabs/readers) even to get _started_ working on the asset decompression and parsing. I didn't really see an existing one that I liked, so I wrote one. I knew relatively early on that a [_monorepo_](https://monorepo.tools/) was probably going to be a good idea; both for some general _separation-of-concerns_ while maintaining some ability to _rapidly_ prototype ideas. I didn't really have a _better_ home for my `BitReader`, so I just threw it in with the rest of the `SCI0` stuff&hellip;

## Time goes on&hellip;

Later, while working on [sci.js](https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js), I wanted a fast ring-buffer `TypedArray`-backed `deque`. Again, I looked around, and didn't see anything that really _fit_ for what I wanted from the interface. So, again, I just built one and threw it in with the rest of the `SCI0` stuff. But it definitely was a _head-tilting moment_. This was the second-time I had shoved a more _general-purpose_ data-structure in a _domain-specific_ monorepo. I decided it was _okay_ for now&mdash;refocusing back on the scope of the overall project.

But&hellip; there was _something_ brewing.

## Third time's the charm!

Fast-forward a few months, and I was working on something totally unrelated: a [`quadtree` and `ennetree`](https://github.com/32bitkid/4bitlabs.spatial). For a _hot-minute_, I thought that maybe a dense `float64` resizable-_vector_ might outperform the native _array_. I thought about using the [`Vector`](https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/vector) class from [mnemonist](https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/), but I wanted to be able to snag quadruples of floats from the backing `TypedArray` with `subarray()`, something mnemonist doesn't support[^subarray].

Long story short, I wrote it and implemented it. Running the benchmarks, it didn't perform any better. It didn't perform _terribly worse_, but it was _way_ more complex with _a lot_ more moving parts. So, I took it out of `quadtree`/`ennetree`. However, it was still _useful_&mdash;like, it wasn't _flawed_&mdash;it just didn't provide the performance _benefits_ that I was hoping it would. But, now I had a bit a problem&hellip;

## The Problem

I had this `BitReader`-class and `Deque`-class in _one_ monorepo, and a `Vector`-class in _another_ monorepo. Neither of which really <q>belonged</q> in their parent repositories. They _actually_ had more in common with _each other_, than they had in the repos they stored in.

_But_ I also didn't want to _lose_ all the commit history and context that I'd built up in those repos. I really wanted to _snatch_ those three packages from their respective repos, and plop them in a new repo, where I could develop and document them in _tandem_. But _how_ to do this&hellip;

## The Process

We probably _could_ go through and try to manually rewrite history with `git rebase -i`, but given that these were all from monorepos there was a _lot_ of cross development across packages. I wasn't, _perhaps_, as _disciplined_ as I should have been crafting my commits. So, I pretty knew that wasn't going to be an option. Luckily, there is a tool just for stuff like this: [`git-filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).

Checking out the [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html), the `--path` option sounds like exactly what I'm looking for!

Let's say that we have two monorepos: `repo1` and `repo2`, I want to make _new_ `repo3`, that contains both `libs/package-a` from `repo1` and `libs/package-b` from `repo2`.

### Step 1: Rewrite repo1

Clone the `repo1` repository[^safe-clone].

```sh
cd ~/src
git clone repo1 repo1-package-a
```

```sh
cd ~/src/repo1-package-a
git checkout -b only-package-a
git filter-repo --path libs/package-a
```

Your branch should now _only_ contain commits that are related to `libs/package-a`.

### Step 2: Rewrite repo2

Repeat for the `repo2` repository[^safe-clone].

```sh
cd ~/src
git clone repo2 repo2-package-b
```

```sh
cd ~/src/repo2-package-b
git checkout -b only-package-b
git filter-repo --path libs/package-b
```

### Step 3

We should now have two repositories with only the commits that we care about for `package-a` and `package-b`. Now we need to create a _new_ repo and merge these disparate histories together. So lets make a new folder and initialize a git repository.

```sh
mkdir ~/src/new-repo
cd ~/src/repo-3
git init
```

Let's just create an initial commit for this new repo by initializing a `README.md`

```sh
echo "Monorepo for package-a and package-b" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

Now, we can add those two other repos with the history that we want as _remotes_.

```sh
git remote add repo1-package-a ../repo1-package-a
git remote add repo2-package-b ../repo2-package-b
git remote update
```

Next we need to merge in those two branches from the repositories we created earlier. Because our current branch and the other branches we want to merge come from _entirely separate_ commit histories, we need to use the `--allow-unrelated-histories` option to merge.

```sh
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories repo1-package-a/only-package-a
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories repo2-package-b/only-package-b
```

And blammo! We should have our two packages now in the same repo, with their respective histories intact[^tag-cleanup].

### Step 4: The Cleanup

Now, we can remove those temp remotes:

```sh
git remote remove repo1-package-a
git remote remove repo2-package-b
```

And then clean up the temp repos `repo1-package-a` and `repo2-package-b`. Finally, you'll probably want to remove the package folders from `repo1` and `repo2`, respectively.

## Conclusion

You probably won't _ever_ need to do this, especially if you spend a little more time on _planning_ than I did. But if you _do_, just remember `git` is a really powerful tool! You can more-or-less coerce it into doing almost anything you want, given enough _effort_. Even in times like this, where `git rebase -i` is insufficient, a myriad of alternatives and other approaches exist. Sometimes, you just have to figure out how to _express_ what you want.

[^subarray]: Total aside: it's kinda _obvious_ why mnemonist _doesn't_ support doing this. Getting array pointers into a _resizable_ backing array which may no longer be _valid_ as the vector is mutated is _demonstrably_ a BadIdea&trade;. I ended up _trashing_ this idea from my own implementation before publishing it.

[^safe-clone]: You don't _need_ to clone the repo for this to work, you _can_ do it in the main repo on another branch, but I whenever I do this kind of _relatively_ hardcore history-rewriting I find that its often easier and safer to do it on a clone of the repo.

[^tag-cleanup]: Depending on how your repos are set up, and what your process is, you might need to clean up _tags_ for unrelated histories. But if you don't use tags then you can ignore this.
