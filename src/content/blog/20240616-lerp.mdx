  A lerp()—or linear-interpolation—is a function that returns a new value between two known samples.

A `lerp(a, b, t)`—or *[linear-interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation)*—is a function that returns *a new value* between two *known samples*, such that when $t$ is $0.0$, then value of $a$ is returned, when $t$ is $1.0$ then the value of $b$ is returned, and when $t$ is $0.5$ then the *value equidistant* between $a$ and $b$ is returned.

Consider the following:

```ts
const lerp = (a: number, b: number, t: number) =>
  a + t * (b - a);
```

We can use this function to generate *new values* between two existing, known values:

```ts
const [start, end] = [10, 50];

console.log(lerp(start, end, 0.1));   /* at 10% */
// ❮ 14

console.log(lerp(start, end, 0.5));   /* at 50% */
// ❮ 30

console.log(lerp(start, end, 0.986)); /* at 98.6% */
// ❮ 49.44
```

## But wait!

There are potential *risks* involved with the previous implementation due to floating-point arithmetic errors. In this case, due to rounding errors, this method does not *guarantee* that `lerp(a, b, 1.0) === b`. For example, let's try to lerp between one *huge* value and one very small value, using the previous implementation:

```ts
console.log(lerp(1e8, 1e-8, 0.0));
// ✅ 100,000,000

console.log(lerp(1e8, 1e-8, 1.0));
// ❌ 0
```

Ouchies! Because the difference between $b$ and $a$ is *smaller* that what a 64-bit floating point number can represent, it gets rounded *out* when doing $(b-a)$. We end up getting a value of $0$, which is *outside* the range of $[a,b]$. To correct for this, it is sometimes recommended to use this implementation, instead:

```ts
const lerp = (a: number, b: number, t: number) =>
  (1 - t) * a + t * b;
```

Given that $t$ is in the range of $[0,1]$, *this* method will precisely start and end with $a$ and $b$ respectively.

```ts
console.log(lerp(1e8, 1e-8, 0.0));
// ✅ 100,000,000

console.log(lerp(1e8, 1e-8, 1));
// ✅ 0.00000001
```

However, this is not without its *own* caveat: outside the range of $[0,1]$ then this function may not be [*monotonic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function). Again, this is due to the limitations of floating-point approximations.

## Higher-order LERPs

It is also sometimes useful to lerp between vectors or tuples, this can easily be achieved by lerping over each component of the vector/tuple:

```ts
type Vec2 = [number, number];

const vecLerp = (a: Vec2, b: Vec2, t: number): Vec2 =>
  [lerp(a[0], b[0], t), lerp(a[1], b[1], t)];
```

This can obviously be extended to vectors and tuples of any length.
