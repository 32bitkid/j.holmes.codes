# AssembyScript MPEG-2 Video Decoder

I've been meaning to take a deep-dive into [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) for a while now, and it seems like picking up [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) would be a fun ride. I've written a basic-profile [MPEG-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2) decoder in the past&hellip; Actually, a few times; [most recently in Go](https://github.com/32bitkid/mpeg). But I think it might be a fun learning exercise to do it targeting the web. It's most definitely not _practical_, in terms of performance or usability, however there are ton of fun algorithms to explore and understand in the domain of video decoding.
