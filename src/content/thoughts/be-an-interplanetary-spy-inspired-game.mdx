# Interplanetary Spy-inspired Adventure Game&hellip;

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about a [Choose-Your-Own-Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)-style book series that I read a _ton_ as a kid: [Be An Interplanetary Spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_an_Interplanetary_Spy).

It was a short series, especially when compared to CYOA, consisting of only _twelve_ entries. They were almost more like comic-books, rather than the more _prose_-centric CYOA books. Definitely some of the artist who worked on those books were _inspirational_ to me and my aesthetic (namely Darrel Anderson and Mark Wheatley).

So, I've been thinking about possibly doing a **Interplanetary Spy**-inspired game or series. Sticking close to the original format, using [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs) with a branching storyline.
