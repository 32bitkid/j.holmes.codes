# Recipe-Box

- [ ] What would a modern-day kitchen **recipe box** look like?
  - [ ] Why does an iPad or tablet suck in the kitchen?
    - [x] The screen turns off!
    - [x] It needs power! _Cables!!_
    - [x] Hands are covered in foodstuffs! I don't want to touch the screen!
- [ ] How should we _share_ and _collaborate_ on food recipes in the 21st century?
  - [ ] Sending a friend/family-member home with a recipe.
  - [ ] Sharing your own changes to recipes back to the person they came from.
- [ ] Old cookbooks with empty pages for adding your own recipes and notes.

I think a lot of these ideas are related/shared with the current ideas of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I think there _something_ here. I envision an open-platform/protocol for sharing recipes without SEO or ads. I could see an eink device that is _designed_ for messy kitchen use that inherits the form-factor from the 19th/20th-century ideas of a recipe box. I see a future where sharing a recipe with a friend is as easy as the push of one button.

I see a open-graph of related recipes and iterations, that is free to navigate and improve with your own preferences and tastes.
