# SCIShop

Thinking about a modern, web-based `SCI0` PIC editor. Think Photoshop but for `SCI0` based resources. The only other editor that I can currently think of is [Phil Fortier's](https://github.com/icefallgames) [SCICompanion](https://scicompanion.com/overview/), but I'm pretty sure thats a Windows-only application. I think it would be _cool_ if there was a quick web-based editor that you could open up an existing `PIC` resource, or start a new image from scratch and save it as a proper patch file.

I have prototyping working on this in [github.com/32bitkid/sci.js](https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js)
