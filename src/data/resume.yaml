      In my role as the <small>Senior Frontend & Design Engineer</small> at Formant, I took charge of maintaining the front-end stack 
      of Formant's robotics observation and remote-operation application. I led efforts to address performance 
      bottlenecks and reactive-data rendering issues across multiple teams. Collaborating closely with the design team, 
      I implemented accessible and reusable components aligned with our UI/UX objectives. I owned the resolution of 
      critical dependency updates and drove efforts to refactor and improve areas of the codebase for future support, 
      maintainability, and security. I optimized the JavaScript bundle to significantly enhance SPA cold-start/FCP time 
      and increase S3 storage efficiency. Working closely with the design team, I established internal UI component 
      documentation and a playground for other frontend engineers, playing a key role in collapsing and consolidating 
      legacy styles and components throughout the codebase.

      During my time at <small>Workboard</small>, I led a cross-functional team and oversaw the development of a real-time 
      communication tool for OKR brainstorming sessions. Think of it as Figma for OKRs. I was responsible for everything 
      from UI/UX to data modeling, and we built a high-performance, infinite-canvas React rendering engine that could be
      reused. Our approach involved using a microservices architecture to tackle challenges such as API design and 
      real-time websocket communication. This product was the first of its kind at Workboard and was designed to be a 
      foundational element for future tools. I worked with the team to establish best practices and scalable 
      microservice architectures. We successfully launched the product to great customer feedback in under six months.

      with product teams, I helped develop and refine shared components and provided mentorship to other front-end 
      engineers on design and implementation best practices. I offered technical oversight and conducted code reviews 
      for React development, Salesforce API design, and database schema feedback for multiple teams, working closely 
      with the DevSec team to address and resolve issues. Moreover, I spearheaded the design and maintenance of build 
      pipelines for product teams, ultimately resulting in the successful implementation of a new unified front-end 
      tooling and deployment process adopted by all front-end teams. This initiative significantly enhanced 
      organizational knowledge and comprehension of front-end deployments and updates across our entire engineering team.

      I have experience in designing and engineering front-ends for industrial automation at scale and viticulture

      The work I did while consulting for BAS was some of the *most interesting*
      work I&rsquo;ve gotten to do professionally. They needed a library of reusable
      custom UI‑framework components, the most ambitious was a custom
      mobile/desktop ready real‑time 3D panoramic viewer component in Flash/AS3.
      I had to dust off several math textbooks from college and refresh my
      working memory of vector and matrix math. However, it was great fun to
      implement a 3D renderer from almost first principals. A lot more work went
      into optimizing performance and building an API and documentation for RAD
      consumption by graphic designers and other junior developers on their team.

      I had a *ton* of fun mentoring at the CoderDojo. The effort was
      spearheaded by a fellow co‑worker. Having buy&#x2011;in/support from our
      employer, we had access to both hardware and facilities to build our curriculum.
      With a half‑dozen volunteer mentors and teachers, we had classes and
      self‑directed sessions for dozens of children between the ages of 10 and
      17. The environment could be chaotic and challenging, but the reward was
      helping expose the next generation to fundamentals of technology and
      programming.
