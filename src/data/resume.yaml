      At <small>niolabs</small>, I led the Innovation Team; we built the prototypes
      for the *next-gen* of niolabs&#x2019; IoT dev-platform. Driving
      innovation was a *full-time* job; I split my time between
      brain-storming new ideas, prototyping experimental features & tools,
      designing educational & marketing material, and coordinating with
      production teams on integration and optimizations
      across the entire tech stack.

      From designing and engineering front-ends for industrial automation
      at scale & viticulture management platforms to leading the charge to
      push the niolabs IoT-platform beyond the *cloud* with deeper
      integrations with *next-gen* edge devices, I helped drive and guide
      the platform forward into uncharted, new territory.

      I loved working at <small>VersionOne</small>; the team was well established and
      full of some of the smartest and most passionate people I&rsquo;ve ever 
      had the opportunity to work with. It is where I fell in love with

      focusing on improving UI and the state of the front-end stack.

      While at VersionOne, I was the Feature Lead on a
      high-profile, well-received feature of the flagship application. During my

      three on the development team. In that role I helped guide, mentor, and 
      support the devs and designers on my team. I coordinated with the other 
      teams and Product Owners to deliver high-quality features and releases.

    description: |
      The work I did while consulting for BAS was some of the *most interesting*
      work I&rsquo;ve gotten to do professionally. They needed a library of reusable
      custom UI-framework components, the most ambitious was a custom
      mobile/desktop ready real-time 3D panoramic viewer compoment in Flash/AS3.
      I had to dust off several math textbooks from college and refresh my
      working memory of vector and matrix math. However, it was great fun to
      implement a 3D renderer from almost first principals. A lot more work went
      into optimizing performance and building an API and documentation for RAD
      consumption by graphic designers and other junior developers on their team.

      FourSpots was an ambitious self-service advertising platform and

      rendering services on top of FFMPEG and Avisynth, as well as custom
      SWF packing for advertisment distribution.

    notes: |
      I had a *ton* of fun mentoring at the CoderDojo. The effort was
      spearheaded by a fellow co-worker. Having buy&#x2011;in/support from our
      employer, we had access to both hardware and facilities to build our curriculum.
      With a half-dozen volunteer mentors and teachers, we had classes and
      self-directed sessions for dozens of children between the ages of 10 and
      17. The environment could be chaotic and challenging, but the reward was
      helping expose the next generation to fundamentals of technology and
      programming.

      My college experience helped solidify my interest in the intersection
      between visual arts and code. Classes like Color Theory, Typography and
      Life Drawing have made an unexpected impact during my professional career.
      And the 3D Modeling and Animation classes were my first exposure to the
      confluence art and mathematics. During my senior year, I was the teaching
      assistant for most of the 3D Modeling and Animation classes; my first
      foray into teaching and education.i
