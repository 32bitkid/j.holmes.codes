I am a _developer_ &amp; _designer_ with a focus on front-end architecture and interaction design. My interests range from UI-design to 80's vintage computers (IBM PC*jr*, Apple //e, C64) to embedded computing, video codecs, CRTs, and pixel-art.

Until <time datetime="2023-11-15">late-2023</time>, I was the _Frontend Engineering Lead_ at [Formant][formant] where I developed prototypes, tools, and designs for the future of robotic fleet monitoring and teleoperation. I love getting my hands dirty, learning new things, and exploring new domains. To me, there isn't a line between engineering and design; I'm equally comfortable in [Sketch][sketch] as I'm in [Sublime Text][subl].

You can find me doodling on [CodePen][codepen], helping other engineers on [StackOverflow][stackoverflow], pushing code to [GitHub][github], or posting on [Mastodon][mstdn] about stuff I think is cool. To get in touch, e-mail me at [j@holmes.codes][email]
