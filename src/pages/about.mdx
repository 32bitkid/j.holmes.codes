# `/about`

Hi, I'm J! I am a _developer_ & _designer_ with a focus on front-end architecture and interaction design. My interests range from UI-design to 80's vintage computers (IBM PC*jr*, Apple //e, C64) to embedded computing, video codecs, CRTs, and pixel-art. See [`/contact`](/contact) for how to keep in touch!
