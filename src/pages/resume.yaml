summary: |
  I am a *full-stack* developer with a focus in front-end engineering and
  user-experience design.

  I craft compelling interactions between people and machines. I bring a
  diverse background of technologies, experiences and passions. I want to help
  build the tools and applications that will empower people to work, play,
  and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;*create*.

  If you share my love of programming&mdash;whether a fellow developer, a
  employer, a client, or just someone who wants to learn&mdash;then get in
  touch; I'd *love* to hear from you and what you are working on!

      Leads To Conversations is a sales acceleration app start-up, founded by a
      pair previous co-workers. I joined the team as the second
      developer&mdash;third employee&mdash;bringing my skills as a UI specialist
      to the team. My skill-set directly complemented the technical founder and
      we worked closely to define, architect and build the pilot system. My
      responsibilities ranged from full-stack pair development to database
      design to devops to graphic/web design to marketing to motion graphics;
      members of small teams wear many hats.

      As the lead front-end developer at Skyward, I worked closely with the lead designer
      to realize and iterate the UI/UX of the application: a UAV flight
      planning, logging, and compliance SAAS. Built on Angular.js, I implemented
      the front-end on-top of the Java backend. Worked dilligently to establish
      the automated testing and build pipelines. Helped mentor junior developers
      within the front-end stack, and transitioned the team
      towards more functional programming paradigms available in Java 8.

      I greatly enjoyed working at VersionOne; the team was well established and
      full of some of the smartest and most passionate people I've had the
      opportunity to work with. It is where I fell in love with
      pair-programming. I joined the team as a full-stack developer; focusing on
      improving UI and the state of the front-end stack.

      While at VersionOne, I was the Feature Lead of a team of four developers on a
      high-profile, well-received [feature](https://www.versionone.com/product/agile-team-software/)
      of the flagship application. During my last year at VersionOne, I was
      tapped to be a Team Lead, one of three on the development team. In
      that role, I helped guide, mentor, and support the devs and designers on
      my team and coordinate with the other teams and Product Owners to deliver
      high-quality features and releases.

      While initially hired as a technical test developer at Clearwave, I was quickly
      conscripted on to the development team where I helped mentor the team in
      ASP.NET MVC, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery best practices. As a Front-End
      Developer, over the course of two years, I was helped establish
      design frameworks and tools for the rest of the development team. I
      continued to work closely with both the business analysts and development
      teams to plan, architect, build and maintain the BDD test suite. Finally,
      I served as team ScrumMaster until my departure, assisting in the
      on-going effort to move to a more agile work paradigm.

    description: |
      The work I did while consulting for BAS was some of the *most interesting*
      work I've gotten to do professionally. They needed a library of reusable
      custom UI-framework components, the most ambitious was a custom
      mobile/desktop ready real-time 3D panoramic viewer compoment in Flash/AS3.
      I had to dust off several math textbooks from college and refresh my
      working memory of vector and matrix math. However, it was great fun to
      implement a 3D renderer from almost first principals. A lot more work went
      into optimizing performance and building an API and documentation for RAD
      consumption by graphic designers and other junior developers on their team.

      FourSpots was an ambitious self-service advertising platform and
      market-place start-up, where I helped implement front-end design and hack
      together back-end. I created API interfaces for custom video editing and
      rendering services on top of FFMPEG and Avisynth, as well as custom
      SWF packing for advertisment distribution.

    to:           '2014-08'
    notes: |
      I had a *ton* of fun mentoring at the CoderDojo. The effort was
      spearheaded by a fellow co-worker. Having buy&#x2011;in/support from our
      employer, we had access to both hardware and facilities to build our curriculum.
      With a half-dozen volunteer mentors and teachers, we had classes and
      self-directed sessions for dozens of children between the ages of 10 and
      17. The environment could be chaotic and challenging, but the reward was
      helping expose the next generation to fundamentals of technology and
      programming.

    notes: |
      My college experience helped solidify my interest in the intersection
      between visual arts and code. Classes like Color Theory, Typography and
      Life Drawing have made an unexpected impact during my professional career.
      And the 3D Modeling and Animation classes were my first exposure to the
      confluence art and mathematics. During my senior year, I was the teaching
      assistant for most of the 3D Modeling and Animation classes; my first
      foray into teaching and education.i
