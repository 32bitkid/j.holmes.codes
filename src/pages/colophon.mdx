# `/colophon`

This site started way back in <YearFmt date="2004"/> as [32bitkid.com](https://32bitkid.com), which I still own the domain for. Fast-forward a few years later, a coworker gave me the somewhat _facetious_ nickname of **refactorman**, in response to my seemingly insatiable _desire_ to refactor the C&#x266F; codebase we worked on together at the time. I rebuilt the site again&mdash;as one does&mdash;as [refactorman.com](https://refactorman.com). Then, in <YearFmt date="2014"/>, when the `.codes` TLD launched the site was _once again_ designed and relaunched as [j.holmes.codes](https://j.holmes.codes).
